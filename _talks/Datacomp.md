The properties of the training dataset in classification and regression problems are investigated. We propose a method for determining the complexity of the training data using a two-layer fully connected neural network. The number of neurons in the inner layer of the neural network is used to determine the complexity. [Book of abstracts, page 68](http://www.machinelearning.ru/wiki/images/b/bf/MMPR2019.pdf)
