The properties of the training dataset in classification and regression problems are investigated. The complexity of the training dataset can be determined using various criteria such as the principle of minimum description length and statisti- cal complexity. It calculates the complexity using approximating models. This is a heuristic approach. In this paper, we propose a method for determining the complex- ity of the training data using a two-layer fully connected neural network. According to Tsybenkoâ€™s theorem, a neural network of direct communication with one hidden layer approximates any continuous function of many variables with a given accuracy. The number of neurons in the inner layer of the neural network is used to determine the complexity.
The properties of this method are investigated. To analyze the method, a compu- tational experiment is performed on synthetic data with different configurations of multicolinear features and noise level. Experiments were also conducted on Boston Housing and Cleveland Heart Disease datasets for regression and binary classification problems.
